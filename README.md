Repositry for the philosophy, branches and such-like are encouraged!
All essays are being stored here as of 02/09/2025
Prior to this we merely stored essays on Substack, however it is useful if we can track version history.
Inside you will find a tweet archive, running parallel to our twitter, and several foundational documents.
These documents are of various quality, the last essay was uploaded in a poor quality state. We intend to finish it, but figured the record would be useful for proving originality. 
Obviously we have version tracking to an extent from our twitter, which you can find at https://x.com/Telzezl. We start our project around 07/08/2025.
